# MOD3

**3D Modifier Library for JavaScript**

This is a port of the [AS3dMod Modifier Library for ActionScript 3](http://code.google.com/p/as3dmod/) to JavaScript.

**version: 1.0.0**

**supports: Three.js, CubicVR.js, OSG.js, J3D, Copperlicht, Pre3d**

[![MOD3.js](/flipbook2.png)](https://foo123.github.io/examples/flipbook3/)

It is an almost complete port. All Modifiers found in AS3DMod are scheduled to be ported.
Also the API architecture is setup for more modifiers to be added (even custom ones).

### Source Code License

[MIT Open Source License](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) like the original [AS3dMod Modifier Library for ActionScript 3](http://code.google.com/p/as3dmod/).

### Live Examples

* [3D flipbook](https://foo123.github.io/examples/flipbook3/) (Three.js, MOD3.js and Tween.js)
* [Dancing Box](https://foo123.github.io/examples/dancing-box/)  (a simple blend of 3D manipulation and sound visualization)


### Support for 3D JavaScript engines

* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) with examples (r78)
* [OSG.js](https://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs) with examples (0.2.5)
* [CubicVR](https://github.com/cjcliffe/CubicVR.js/) with examples
* [J3D](https://github.com/drojdjou/J3D) with examples (Build 51)
* [Copperlicht](https://github.com/Sebmaster/copperlicht) with examples
* [Pre3d](https://github.com/deanm/pre3d) with examples (pre3d examples are a little blurry but you'll get the picture)



### Modifiers supported (up to present)
* Pivot (note: Pivot does not work with Pre3d)
* Bend
* Twist
* Taper
* Skew
* Noise
* Wheel
* Bloat
* Break
* Perlin
* DisplaceMap


### TODO
* possible generic way to use (at least some) 3D modifiers directly in GLSL for all supported engines (??)
* add custom modifiers except the defaults found in AS3dMod library
* optimize (math ops, caching, modifier chain calls etc..) [DONE partially]
* port the modifiers that use Perlin Noise (using instead the simpler and faster Simplex Noise routine for JavaScript, [noisejs](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs) , or [simplex-noise.js](https://github.com/jwagner/simplex-noise.js)) [DONE partially]
* keep up with JavaScript 3D Engines updates (will try)


### How to debug
1. If the problem is in one 3D engine, while the other engines work correctly for this example/modifier, then the problem is probably with that engine's proxy classes (plugins/3DENGINENAME/3DENGINENAME.js)
2. If the specific example/modifier does not work in any 3D engine, but other modifiers/examples do work, then the problem is probably with that modifier's code (modifiers/MODIFIERNAME.js)
3. If no example works for any engine, then the problem is probably in the core classes, or some class throws a js error which stops the whole execution


### Changelog
* 1.0.0 refactor, simplify and minify code, remove classy dependency
* 0.6.0  3d engine plugins have been removed from the final build to make packaged code lighter, include the appropriate 3D plugin **manualy in your application** after the main **mod3** script (see examples), modifiers are independent of the underlying modifiable mesh (it is a parameter), and this enables them to be shared (if the exact same modifier is needed) across multiple different modifierStacks for different underlying meshes, support for OSG.js, further refactoring and optimisations, some method changes
* 0.5.0  parallel processing through workers is dropped, add support for OSG.js (in progress), update support for Three.js r78, some refactoring and optimisations
* 0.4  support parallel modifiers with web workers transparently, code refactor, optimizations, examples updates
* 0.3.5  DisplaceMap modifier added, edits / optimizations
* 0.3.4  update classy.js, code refactor / optimizations, Perlin modifier added
* 0.3.2-0.3.3  update buildtools, api-reference, classy.js, Three.js revision (r66)
* 0.3.1  update buildtools, api-reference, use classy.js for OOP
* 0.3  code refactoring, extension framework, various optimizations, tidy up repo, new build scripts, project stopped
* added support for CubicVR.js 3D Engine, minor optimizations for all engines
* added support for Three.js revision (r58)
* added support for Three.js revision (r53)
